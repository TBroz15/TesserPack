TesserPack is kinda bare bones right now. PR contributions and how to develop on TesserPack is not completely considered until v1 is being released. Feel free to report any issues!

> [!WARNING]
> **ALL SETUPS FOR DEVELOPMENT ARE NOT TESTED AND CONSIDERED!**

## Before Sending Issues...

- Please check if your issue is already resolved, so your issue won't be closed as duplicate.
- If you are making a bug report, please make sure the reproduction process is accurate as possible.
- If your bug report is related to pack compilation, please upload and include your pack into your issue for better reproduction.
- TesserPack's intention was to optimize Minecraft packs for production. So make sure to stay on topic!

## Windows Setup (for development & PR)

> [!NOTE]
> Windows Defender and other anti-viruses tend to slow down the compilation process,
> since TesserPack isn't a well recognized program and think it's a sus program. (we are not sus à¶ž)
>
> There are 3 solutions to this, 
> 1. Add Go's binaries and TesserPack binary to Windows Defender exclusions.
> 2. Temporarily disable the anti-virus. (not recommended)
> 3. Just simply use Linux. (windows bad, linux good -TuxeBro)

0.  Preparations
    1. [Download and install Go](https://go.dev/dl/) `<=` 1.25 if you haven't. Read the [guide](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started#prerequisites).
    2. [Download Libvips](https://github.com/libvips/build-win64-mxe/releases/download/v8.17.1/vips-dev-w64-web-8.17.1.zip) and extract it.
    3. Go to the extracted directory and put `vips-dev-8.17` into `C:\`.
    4. Add Environmental Variables in Powershell. (you don't need epic admin powers btw...)
        ```powershell
        # Adds libvips to PATH
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$([Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User"));C:\vips-dev-8.17\bin", "User")

        # Add libvips's pkgconfig dir to PKG_CONFIG_PATH, so govips will recognize it.
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PKG_CONFIG_PATH", "$([Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PKG_CONFIG_PATH", "User"));C:\vips-dev-8.17\lib\pkgconfig", "User")
        
        # Set jsonv2 to GOEXPERIMENT, so TesserPack can use encoding/json/v2
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("GOEXPERIMENT", "jsonv2", "User")
        ```
