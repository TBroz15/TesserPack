## TODO (for TuxeBro)

- [x] Implement main features (such as JSON, assets, and zip compression)
- [x] JSON5 support (pack devs will like this)
- [ ] Caching
- [ ] Proper error checking
- [ ] Config
- [ ] GUI w/ wails (so people wont just type in their terminal to look like some sort of hacker) (TBD by v1.0)
- [ ] Minify JS & TS through ESBuild (TBD by v1.1)
- [ ] Regolith Integration
- [ ] ARM64 Support
- [ ] Do some optimizations (ive learnt a lesson to not optimize until all the program features is ready)
- [ ] Fix some memory leaks (likely related to JSON & LANG stripping)
- [ ] Proper Linux Support? (libvips is the problem)
- [ ] TesserPack as Go package
